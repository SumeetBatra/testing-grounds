  <p><b>Bio: </b>I am an Undergraduate Student majoring in Computer Science at the
  University of Colorado Boulder with minors in Applied Math and Japanese.
  I am currently working as an undergraduate research assistant at the
  <a href="http://cairo-lab.com">Cairo Lab</a> for Human-Robotic Interaction through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms for autonomous robotic systems.
  Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://correll.cs.colorado.edu">Correll Lab</a> on using
  a swarm robotics with augmented reality for teaching atomic chemistry to pre-collegiate students.

    <b>Personal Interests/Hobbies: </b> I am currently studying Japanese and plan to
    reach native level proficiency! I had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan for 6 months,
    meet a truly wonderful group of people and gain new perspectives. When I'm at home, I'm taking up the
    (rather expensive) hobby of building/upgrading my own Desktop PC's, running dualboots and
    occasionally booting a modern game for the eye candy.
